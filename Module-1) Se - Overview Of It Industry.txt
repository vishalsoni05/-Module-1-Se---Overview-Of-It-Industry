Q1. What is software? What is software engineering?

ANS 
1 :- software 
Software is a set of instructions, data or programs which is used to operate computers and perform a specific tasks which is given to the computer 

2 :- software Engineering 
Software engineering is an engineering  to design, develop, test, and maintain the software. It aims to produce high-quality software that is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and fulfil the needs of users.

Q2. Explain types of software
 
Ans:- There are many types of software like

Application software.
System software.
Middleware.
Driver software.
Programming software.
Freeware.
Open source software.
Proprietary software or close software.

The two main categories of software are application software and system software. 

An application is software that fulfils a specific need or performs tasks

System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.

Q3. What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC

Ans:- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). is a process that helps to develop high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest time

Planning
planning is all about what we want in project and to build it like assign 
the tasks and resources required to build the project.      

Analysis  
Analysis: This phase involves     
gathering information about the software requirement from coustomer.

Design 
In this phase, the software design is created, which includes the architecture of the software.

Implications (coding)
The devloper devlop the software by writing code on the basis of design and programming  language they chose

Testing 
After the software was developed . 
The next phase was  Testing: The software is tested to ensure that it meets the user requirements and works correctly.

Maintenance 
This phase is about to maintain the software. This phase includes bug fixes and updates to the software.


4. What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart


ANS:- DFD (Data Flow Diagram) is a graphical representation of the flow of data through a system or process. It's a visualization tool used to:

1. Identify and clarify system requirements
2. Model data flow and interactions
3. Analyze and improve system efficiency

A DFD typically consists of:

1. Processes (represented by bubbles or rectangles)
2. Data flows (represented by arrows)
3. Data stores (represented by open-ended rectangles)
4. External entities (represented by rectangles or squares)
